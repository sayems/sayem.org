The sections below include all of Udacity's [**Android-related courses**](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android), including their [**Android Basics**](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) & [**Android Developer**](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) Nanodegree material.

The complete course list is presently lacking a linear curriculum, so this reference aims to provide a clear, easy to follow path based on each course's prerequisites. The course order in the "*Full Curriculum*" sections is structured so that inidividuals with no prior programming experience can work through them from start to finish.

All of the [**courses can be taken for free**](http://imgur.com/a/GoLJF); although the paid Nanodegree programs do offer additional benefits, including:
 
 
 - a Google-accredited certificate of completion
 - code reviews & guidance by Google-certified instructors
 - access to a course support forum
 - guaranteed job eligibility ([***Nanodegree Plus***](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree/plus))
