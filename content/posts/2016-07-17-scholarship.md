A few days ago I participated in a competition to get scholarship from Udacity, an online learning platform. The competition is runned until December 31st or until thereâ€™s 100 people who finished Android Basic Nanodegree program.

Whoever finished the program from 1st to 100th participant will get full scholarship from Udacity for [Android Developer Nanodegree][2] sponsored by Google.

After struggling for a few days to finished the Nanodegree as soon as I can, I got positioned number 128. Which mean I will not get the scholarship but I am happy that I finish the program.
