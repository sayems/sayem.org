Today, I graduated with an Android Basics Nanodegree by Google. The course was co-created by Google and Udacity. Over the last 2 months, I have learned an incredible amount about developing Android app. Not only did I complete the projects neccessary for graduation, but I also created more projects on the side to learn more skills. Over the course of those 2 months, I built 10 Android apps. While I have learned a ton during this period, there is still so much to learn about Android Development.

I decided to start the Android Basics Nanodegree at Udacity because I wanted a guided way of learning by industry professionals. It also helped that they were partnered with a lot of big companies and offered code reviews for all of your projects. While there are a lot of online options for bootcamps, Udacity was by far the cheapest and offered an environment that was more tailored to my style. With great reviews for the course, I signed up for the Nanodegree.

Overall, it was wonderful experience taking Android Basics Nanodegree by Google and graduating successfully. I would highly recommend any beginner or intermediate developer to take the Android Basics Nanodegree on Udacity.
