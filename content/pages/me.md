I am an software engineer with wide range of skills in many areas of engineering including Android development. I have over 8+ years experience in designing, building and maintaining automation frameworks from scratch using open-source tools such as Selenium/Appium written in various programming languages including Java, C#, and Python.

In my spare time, I like working on various side project, pretty much every skills that I developed were a result of working on a side project. It helped me in both my career and in my side projects. I find this is a great way to experiment with new technologies, try new processes and be able to fail with absolutely no consequences other than maybe a few days wasted. I strongly feel that the technology field moves fast, and I must keep learning to be able to keep up with it. I am determined to fine-tune my skills and continue to learn new things as the industry changes.
